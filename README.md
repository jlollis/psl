# This project is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to act as a static site generator.

First install gem dependencies by running:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Next, start the server by running:

```
jekyll serve -w
```

The website should now be running at `http://localhost:4000`.

The site is also running [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a preprocessor for it's CSS. It is using
[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) for addition mixins and functions that are not
provided in Sass and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) for a responsive grid framework.

# Pull Requests
For any changes to the site please create a fork or a new branch. Put all of your changes
into the branch and submit a pull request.
